# Game of Life

This is a simulator in Javascript based on John Conway's Game of Life: A zero-player game which evolves from its initail state. <br>

The simulator includes a pause button, a reset button, and a slider to change the evolving speed. <br>

It follows the rules below and evolve constantly: <br>

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
